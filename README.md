## Let's see if you can run it run it...

While we are setting up the general project, it can be tested/viewed inside of any modern browser window. In order to do
so you will need to download the project and save it somewhere on your local machine, then it can be opened in a 
browser. There are two common ways that this is accomplished.

1. You can locate the index.html file inside of your OS file manager, right click the file and open with any browser.
1. You can open a browser window and type the local path for the index.html file into the url bar.

## Developing Guidlines

There are a few patterns that we are going to follow, this list will be updated as we go.

### Humpdayyy

Our code will use the [camelCase](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) format for all variables

``` javascript
thisIsCamel
this_is_not
```

### Brace yourself

Brackets should be placed on the same line as the statement itself unless the bracket is for a class, i.e.

``` javascript
if (validateSomething) {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do something else
}
```

### Tabs for days

In all files other than the README file, we will be using tabs instead of spaces. Make sure to set your editor
 settings accordingly.

### Don't be short with me ... or do

Line length should aim to be under 120 characters, use another line if needed.
